- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rising-dancho, a.k.a. jose a. perez jr. a relentless demon, an unyielding and unconquerable soul, a strategist, a keen observer, and a friend  :) currently specializing on javascript, MERN stack, react-native, flutter + python backend + opencv + pytorch mobile.. after gulping a copious amount of css Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
- ðŸ§— Adaptable and calm under pressure.
- ðŸ‘€ In my free time, you'll find me jogging, doing muay thai, playing dota 2 (successfully [quitted dota](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/487426800) btw, not an addict anymore), building/fixing computers, reading about psychology, learning how to cook, and taking care of my cats. I also like exploring diverse topics of personal interest on youtube
