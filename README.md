- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rising-dancho, a.k.a. jose a. perez jr. a relentless demon, an unconquerable soul, a strategist, a keen observer, and a friend  :) currently specializing on javascript and reactjs after gulping on more than my fair share of css.
- ðŸ‘€ In my free time, you'll find me jogging, doing muay thai, playing dota 2 (succussfully [quitted dota](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/487426800), not an addict anymore), building/fixing computers, reading about psychology, learning how to cook, and taking care of my cats. I also like exploring diverse topics of personal interest on youtube
- ðŸ“« You can also find me @[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/adfinemrising) i do some alright things there
